Timezone names in tzdata [1] is a good example, but you don't need to load the JSON example [2] as-is. -- User should be blocked from submit the input unless the input matches one of the entries. -- The whole thing should work when loading from http://localhost/ or file:/// url, without server-side (e.g. PHP) logic. -- Please take care of memory consumption and efficiency. -- Consider making your code unit-testable and reusable.\r\n\r\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzdata [2] https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/shared/resources/tz.json\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in my works, please have a visit to my blog. http://studiobinghuan.blogspot.tw/ and http://bhtalk.blogspot.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
