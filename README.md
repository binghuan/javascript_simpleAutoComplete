=============================

an auto-complete widget on a text &lt;input> with the following requirements:

Implement an auto-complete widget on a text <input> with the
following requirements:

-- Avoid using well-known UI libraries.
-- The dataset should contains around 100~1000 entries. Timezone names
in tzdata [1] is a good example, but you don't need to load the JSON
example [2] as-is.
-- User should be blocked from submit the input unless the input
matches one of the entries.
-- The whole thing should work when loading from http://localhost/ or
file:/// url, without server-side (e.g. PHP) logic.
-- Please take care of memory consumption and efficiency.
-- Consider making your code unit-testable and reusable.
